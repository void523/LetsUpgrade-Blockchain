ASSIGNMENT 1

1) What is your understanding of blockchain?
ans: Blockchain can be defined as a digital ledger which has certain qualities that makes it non vulnerable and unaccountable to third party sources
     which keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place in a secure, chronological, and immutable way.
     A blockchain is a chain of blocks which contain information. Each block records all of the recent transactions,
     and once completed goes into the blockchain as a permanent database
     
2) What are the core problems blockchain is trying to solve?
ans: The actual core problems that blockchain is capable of solving are the current issues of the internet.
     It reinforces itself to the next internet2.0 ,thus compensating the issues of unverifiable , tamperproof data.
     It also helps in solving the issues of “Decentralisation and Authentication” of Data.

3) What are the few features that blockchain give you?
ans: 1. Authenticity
     2.Security
     3.No requirement of third party sources
     4.Tamperproof
     5.Verifiable
     6.Immutable
     7.Unchangable

4) What does a block contain?
ans: 1.Block number 
     2.Records.
     3. Previous block signature
     4.Mining Key   
5) How is the verifiability of Blockchain has been attained ?
ans: Block 1:
     inital_fingerprint(zero) + Data = Fingerkey 1
     Block 2:
     Fingerkey 1 + New Data = Fingerkey 2
